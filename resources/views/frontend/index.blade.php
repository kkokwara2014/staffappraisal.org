            Every Organization has a specific period at which her Staff should be 
            assessed to ascertain their level of commitment to their assigned duties. 
            It is through appraisal that such verifications are made. Promotions on the other 
            hand is a post-appraisal activity which stands as a reward to smart-working 
            Staff in an Organization. A huge task as Staff appraisal should be made simple 
            for both Staff and their Employers. This platform has been crafted to 
            relief the shackles placed on Staff promotions due to delay in appraisal.
